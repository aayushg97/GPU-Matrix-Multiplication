		Team Self Evaluation Form, Assignment #2

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A:	Aayush Gupta

 
B:	Sahil Bhalla

 
 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project, in HOURS.

  	                        A 	       	B
meetings 	  	  	4 		4		   
coding 	  	  	 	10		5		   
writeup 	  	  	8		3
planning (alone) 	  	3		6 
total (including meetings) 	25		18  	  	 


(3) Describe 
  (a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
		Aayush: Implemented first version of tiling,
				Computation of multiple outputs per thread,
				Use of rectangular tiles for optimization,
				Report Writing
				
		Sahil:	Report Writing/Data Collection,
			Handling of non-divisble Ns,
			Optimization of tile sizes
		
  (b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
		Yes
		
  (c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
      your team worked together;
	  We were good at working asynchronously.
	  We used tools like github and overleaf for collaboration
	  
  (d) the lessons learned from these events;
		A GPU can do matrix multiplication many many times faster than a CPU
		
  (e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
		No, we don't plan to change anything
		
  (f) anything else that comes to mind.
		No
